![US Population Data](screenshot.png?raw=true)

This HTML file fetches and displays US population data from the datausa.io API. It utilizes JavaScript to make a fetch request to the API endpoint, retrieves the data, and dynamically populates an HTML table with the year and population columns. The table is styled using CSS for a clean and organized display. The fetched data is sorted by year before being displayed in the table.
